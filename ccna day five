# CCNA Exam Preparation: Day 5

## Intro to ACL and Wildcard Masks

Access Control Lists (ACLs) are a fundamental security feature in networking that filter traffic based on specified criteria. They act as packet filters, controlling which traffic can pass through network devices.

### ACL Fundamentals

1. **Purpose of ACLs**:

1. Traffic filtering (permit or deny)
2. Classification for QoS
3. NAT and route filtering
4. Trigger dial-on-demand routing
5. Control routing updates



2. **ACL Processing Logic**:

1. ACLs are processed in sequential order (top-down)
2. Once a match is found, the action is taken and no further statements are checked
3. If no match is found, the packet is denied (implicit deny at the end)



3. **Types of ACLs**:

1. **Standard ACLs**: Filter based on source IP address only
2. **Extended ACLs**: Filter based on source/destination IP, protocol, and port numbers
3. **Named ACLs**: Use names instead of numbers for easier identification
4. **Reflexive ACLs**: Allow return traffic for established sessions
5. **Time-based ACLs**: Apply restrictions based on time of day



4. **ACL Numbering**:

1. **1-99, 1300-1999**: Standard IP ACLs
2. **100-199, 2000-2699**: Extended IP ACLs
3. **200-299**: Protocol type-code ACLs
4. **300-399**: DECnet ACLs
5. **400-499**: XNS standard ACLs
6. **500-599**: XNS extended ACLs
7. **600-699**: AppleTalk ACLs
8. **700-799**: 48-bit MAC address ACLs
9. **800-899**: IPX standard ACLs
10. **900-999**: IPX extended ACLs
11. **1000-1099**: IPX SAP ACLs





### Wildcard Masks

Wildcard masks are used with ACLs to specify which bits in an IP address should be examined. They are the inverse of subnet masks.

1. **Wildcard Mask Basics**:

1. **0**: Match this bit
2. **1**: Ignore this bit (wildcard)



2. **Common Wildcard Masks**:

1. **0.0.0.0**: Match exactly one address
2. **0.0.0.255**: Match a /24 network
3. **0.0.255.255**: Match a /16 network
4. **0.255.255.255**: Match a /8 network
5. **255.255.255.255**: Match any address



3. **Calculating Wildcard Masks**:

1. Method 1: Subtract the subnet mask from 255.255.255.255

1. Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
2. Wildcard mask: 255.255.255.255 - 255.255.255.0 = 0.0.0.255



2. Method 2: Convert the subnet mask to binary, flip the bits, convert back to decimal

1. Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 = 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
2. Flip bits: 00000000.00000000.00000000.11111111
3. Wildcard mask: 0.0.0.255






4. **Special Wildcard Masks**:

1. **Host**: 0.0.0.0 (match a specific host)
2. **Any**: 255.255.255.255 (match any host)





### Standard ACLs

Standard ACLs filter traffic based on source IP address only.

```shellscript
# Create a standard numbered ACL
Router(config)# access-list 10 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
Router(config)# access-list 10 deny any

# Create a standard named ACL
Router(config)# ip access-list standard ALLOW-ADMIN
Router(config-std-nacl)# permit 192.168.1.10 0.0.0.0
Router(config-std-nacl)# permit 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255
Router(config-std-nacl)# deny any
Router(config-std-nacl)# exit

# Apply a standard ACL to an interface
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
Router(config-if)# ip access-group 10 in
# Or for named ACL
Router(config-if)# ip access-group ALLOW-ADMIN in
```

### Extended ACLs

Extended ACLs filter traffic based on source/destination IP, protocol, and port numbers.

```shellscript
# Create an extended numbered ACL
Router(config)# access-list 101 permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 80
Router(config)# access-list 101 permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 443
Router(config)# access-list 101 deny ip any any

# Create an extended named ACL
Router(config)# ip access-list extended WEB-TRAFFIC
Router(config-ext-nacl)# permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 80
Router(config-ext-nacl)# permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 443
Router(config-ext-nacl)# deny ip any any
Router(config-ext-nacl)# exit

# Apply an extended ACL to an interface
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
Router(config-if)# ip access-group 101 out
# Or for named ACL
Router(config-if)# ip access-group WEB-TRAFFIC out
```

### ACL Placement Best Practices

1. **Standard ACLs**:

1. Place as close to the destination as possible
2. Applied in the inbound direction



2. **Extended ACLs**:

1. Place as close to the source as possible
2. Applied in the outbound direction



3. **General Guidelines**:

1. One ACL per protocol per interface per direction
2. Organize from most specific to least specific
3. Consider the implicit deny at the end
4. Use remarks to document ACL purpose





```shellscript
# Add remarks to ACLs
Router(config)# access-list 101 remark Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic from LAN
Router(config)# access-list 101 permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 80

# For named ACLs
Router(config)# ip access-list extended WEB-TRAFFIC
Router(config-ext-nacl)# remark Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic from LAN
Router(config-ext-nacl)# permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 80
```

### IPv6 ACLs

IPv6 ACLs are similar to IPv4 ACLs but with some differences.

```shellscript
# Create an IPv6 ACL
Router(config)# ipv6 access-list IPV6-TRAFFIC
Router(config-ipv6-acl)# permit tcp 2001:db8:1::/64 any eq 80
Router(config-ipv6-acl)# permit tcp 2001:db8:1::/64 any eq 443
Router(config-ipv6-acl)# deny ipv6 any any
Router(config-ipv6-acl)# exit

# Apply an IPv6 ACL to an interface
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
Router(config-if)# ipv6 traffic-filter IPV6-TRAFFIC in
```

### ACL Verification and Troubleshooting

```shellscript
# View ACLs
Router# show access-lists
Router# show ip access-lists
Router# show ipv6 access-lists

# View specific ACL
Router# show access-list 101
Router# show ip access-list WEB-TRAFFIC

# View ACLs applied to interfaces
Router# show ip interface
Router# show ipv6 interface

# View ACL statistics
Router# show access-lists 101
Router# show ip access-lists WEB-TRAFFIC

# Clear ACL counters
Router# clear access-list counters
Router# clear ip access-list counters 101
Router# clear ip access-list counters WEB-TRAFFIC

# Debug ACLs
Router# debug ip packet detail 101
```

### Common ACL Issues

1. **Order of Statements**:

1. More specific entries should come before less specific ones
2. Remember the implicit deny at the end



2. **Direction of Application**:

1. Inbound vs. outbound can significantly affect behavior
2. Consider traffic flow when applying ACLs



3. **Missing Statements**:

1. Forgetting to allow return traffic
2. Not accounting for control traffic (routing protocols, ICMP, etc.)



4. **Overlapping Statements**:

1. Later statements may never be reached due to earlier matches

The 802.11 MAC (Media Access Control) layer defines the frame format and access methods for wireless communication.

### 802.11 Frame Types

1. **Management Frames**:

1. Control association, authentication, and coordination
2. Examples: Beacon, Probe Request/Response, Authentication, Association Request/Response, Disassociation, Deauthentication



2. **Control Frames**:

1. Assist in the delivery of data frames
2. Examples: RTS (Request to Send), CTS (Clear to Send), ACK (Acknowledgment)



3. **Data Frames**:

1. Carry actual data payload
2. Can include QoS information





### 802.11 Frame Format

1. **Frame Control Field**:

1. Protocol Version
2. Type (Management, Control, Data)
3. Subtype (specific frame function)
4. Various flags (To DS, From DS, More Fragments, Retry, Power Management, etc.)



2. **Duration/ID Field**:

1. Time needed to transmit the frame and acknowledgment
2. Used for virtual carrier sensing (NAV)



3. **Address Fields**:

1. Up to 4 address fields depending on frame type
2. Source Address (SA)
3. Destination Address (DA)
4. Transmitter Address (TA)
5. Receiver Address (RA)
6. BSSID (usually the MAC address of the AP)



4. **Sequence Control Field**:

1. Fragment number
2. Sequence number



5. **QoS Control Field**:

1. Present in QoS data frames
2. Contains traffic identifier (TID)
3. Indicates traffic priority
4. Controls acknowledgment policy



6. **Frame Body**:

1. Contains the actual data payload
2. Variable length (0-2304 bytes)
3. Encrypted if security is enabled



7. **Frame Check Sequence (FCS)**:

1. 32-bit CRC for error detection
2. Calculated over all fields except FCS itself
3. Receiver recalculates and compares to detect errors





### Key Management Frames

1. **Beacon Frame**:

1. Broadcast periodically by AP
2. Contains SSID, supported rates, security information
3. Used for AP discovery and timing synchronization
4. Typically sent every 100ms



2. **Probe Request/Response**:

1. Probe Request: Sent by client to discover APs
2. Probe Response: Sent by AP in response to Probe Request
3. Contains similar information to Beacon frames



3. **Authentication Frame**:

1. Initiates the authentication process
2. Contains authentication algorithm and sequence number
3. May contain challenge text for shared key authentication



4. **Association Request/Response**:

1. Association Request: Sent by client to join a BSS
2. Association Response: Sent by AP to accept or reject the request
3. Contains capability information and supported rates



5. **Disassociation/Deauthentication**:

1. Sent to terminate an association or authentication
2. Contains reason code
3. Can be sent by either client or AP





### Key Control Frames

1. **Request to Send (RTS)**:

1. Used to reserve the medium for transmission
2. Helps address hidden node problem
3. Contains duration information for NAV setting



2. **Clear to Send (CTS)**:

1. Response to RTS
2. Also sets NAV for other stations
3. Can be sent to self for protection



3. **Acknowledgment (ACK)**:

1. Confirms successful receipt of a frame
2. If no ACK is received, sender will retransmit





### MAC Layer Operations

1. **Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)**:

1. Listen before transmit (physical carrier sense)
2. Use NAV for virtual carrier sense
3. Random backoff if medium is busy
4. Reduces collision probability



2. **Network Allocation Vector (NAV)**:

1. Virtual carrier sensing mechanism
2. Stations set a timer based on duration field in frames
3. Prevents transmission during this time
4. Helps address hidden node problem



3. **Distributed Coordination Function (DCF)**:

1. Basic access method for 802.11
2. Uses CSMA/CA
3. All stations compete equally for medium



4. **Point Coordination Function (PCF)**:

1. Optional polling-based access method
2. Provides contention-free access period
3. Rarely implemented in practice



5. **Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA)**:

1. QoS extension to DCF
2. Provides traffic prioritization
3. Four access categories with different parameters
4. Part of 802.11e/WMM





### Frame Analysis Tools

1. **Wireshark**:

1. Captures and analyzes 802.11 frames
2. Requires monitor mode capable wireless adapter
3. Provides detailed frame decoding



2. **Omnipeek**:

1. Commercial wireless packet analyzer
2. Specialized for wireless troubleshooting
3. Provides expert analysis and visualization



3. **Aircrack-ng Suite**:

1. Open-source wireless analysis tools
2. Includes Airodump-ng for frame capture
3. Primarily used for security testing



4. **Cisco Wireless LAN Controller**:

1. Provides frame capture capabilities
2. Can export captures for analysis in Wireshark
3. Useful for troubleshooting client connectivity issues
